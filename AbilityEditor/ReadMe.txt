[h1]Usage[/h1]

Can be used by other mods to modify existing abilitiy templates by adding [u]XComAbilityEditor.ini[/u] to the mod config.
Can be used by anyone willing to tweak his game even more.

[u]Examples:[/u]
[code]
[AbilityEditor.OPTC_Abilities]
;This will replace Combat Protocol charges to 3 turns cooldown
;+Abilities = (AbilityName=CombatProtocol, Cooldown=3, EndsTurn=true)

; This will allow Ranger to have an action after Slash
;+Abilities = (AbilityName=SwordSlice, APCost=1, EndsTurn=true, DoNotConsumeAllActionsWith[0]=Blademaster)

; Gives 9 charges of Scanning Protocol, is a free action and can be used every two turns
;+Abilities = (AbilityName=ScanningProtocol, Cooldown=2, Charges=9, FreeAction=true)

; Restoration grants 3 extra charges of Heals
;+Abilities = (AbilityName=GremlinHeal, Charges=2, BonusChargeWith[0]=(BonusAbilityName=RestorativeMist, NumBonusCharges=3) )
[/code]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
It should be compatible with everything.
Changes are taken into account if using [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1289686596][WOTC] Cost-Based Ability Colors[/url]

[h1]Note[/h1]
I did not focus on damages because they are mainly editable from ini files.
